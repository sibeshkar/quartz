title: "The Anatomy Of The New"
---
A scribble on a napkin. A single low-pitched note. A few lines of code. A solitary word on a piece of paper.  
  
The new has no friends.  
  
Only enemies.  
  
Faceless committees. Insipid money bags. Experts eager to "temper expectations". Rent-seeking bureaucrats in a suit. Feckless critics. Promising distractions at every turn.  
  
It is a miracle how anything new comes to be, considering how easy it was to nip it in the bud.  
  
The history books make it sound inevitable, but nothing was built on its own. Someone had to make it happen.  
  
The new is born out of the tenacity of a few.  
  
Only the mad man looks at a single mark against a blank canvas and takes a blind leap of faith, fighting against every odd to bring it to life.  
  
A more reasonable animal, once drowned, would never again dare to cross the sea.  
  
A more reasonable animal, once burnt, would never again try to tame fire.  
  
We are descendants of the most unreasonable ape.  
  
So, down with bureaucracies. Down with faceless committees. Down with efficient markets. Down with focus groups. Down with fashionable trends.  
  
The new is a conspiracy against the world. A bold act of war.  
  
Only the bravest choose to fight. Only the bravest wield their swords.  
  
But with the right weapon, the lone warrior turns into an army.  
  
With the right weapon, David beats Goliath.  
  
What does such a weapon look like?  
  
A powerful machine that can program itself to do any task. That can paint images on command. Study reams of papers. Turn words into stories. Shape stories into moving pictures. Turn hums into music. Create new worlds from imagination. Fashion useful tools from nothing.  
  
A machine that turns the thinker into the doer.  
  
If such a machine were put in the hands of anyone with an idea, how much new music, art, writing, science and enterprise would see the light of day - every day?  
  
There is a gilded age of ideas on the other side, of a kind we've never seen before.  
  
The new needs no friends.  
  
The new starts with an audience of one.
