title : A Path to Unbounded Generality (WIP)
---
A thought is a program, and so viewed from the lens of information theory, there are broadly three distinct universalities in entities that can think [[1]](https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1656437115901624322) : 
1. Computational - can run any given program
2. Reachability - can eventually generate any program, taking arbitrary steps in the process
3. Comparison - can compare and select program options using any criteria


```lisp
(GROUP_OUTPUT 
	 (CURVE_TO_MESH 
		 (CURVE_PRIMITIVE_CIRCLE 32 (-1 0 0) (0 10) (1 0 0) 
			 (VALUE 20)) 
				 (CURVE_PRIMITIVE_QUADRILATERAL 
					 (VALUE 20) 2 4 2 1 3 1 (-1-1 0) (1 -1 0) (11 0) (-1 1 0)) False) null)
```
