A thought is a program, and so viewed from the lens of information theory, there are broadly three distinct universalities in entities that can think and generalize [[1]](https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1656437115901624322) : 

1. Computational - can run any given program
2. Reachability - can eventually generate any program, taking arbitrary steps in the process
3. Comparison - can compare and select program options using any criteria

While arguably these universalities are at play for all sorts of tasks - from the mundane to the profound - their utility becomes truly clear when one examines the problem of [extreme generalization](https://blog.mayalabs.io/benchmark), or, discovering new knowledge that does not resemble anything in the training set.

New discovery requires finding a new underlying explanation for two or more things that everyone  assumed had no relation.

This needs a causal understanding of those things, a world model of both that can be malleably updated on the go, with sparse data, in order to compare and find a common subgraph between them.

Say a digital agent was tasked with discovering a theory of everything - an elusive explanation to unify the discrete small scales and continous large scales in physics. It would need to synthesize hypothesis programs and test them against observations in both quantum mechanics and general relatively. This is a difficult, time-taking process, for a couple of reasons : 

1. The agent would need to poke the world along axes that are not indexed in any training data / are not represented in any geometric space
2. The symbols for expressing such an explantion likely don't exist yet, and definitely not in sufficient quantity to learn via pattern-matching
3. The tools for building a simulated world model at the right level of abstraction would need to be constructed by the agent
4. The synthesis process will require compressing the evolution of both QM and GR into one recursive program that models the evolution of time, in order to find an isomorphism

If/when an isomorphism is found among pairs of such programs, that would unify both these fields. 

Suffice to day, today's machines are nowhere near being capable at such universality. Starting with the right questions is the first step to building them one day.
