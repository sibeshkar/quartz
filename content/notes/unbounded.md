A thought is a program, and so viewed from the lens of information theory, there are broadly three distinct universalities in entities that can think [[1]](https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1656437115901624322) :

2. Reachability - can eventually generate any program, taking arbitrary steps in the process
3. Comparison - can compare and select program options using any criteria
