founder/ceo @ [mayalabs.io](https://mayalabs.io) - applied research lab on a mission to build machines which will programs themselves to do any task.

areas of interest:

1. symbolic AI & program synthesis
2. non-local theories of physics
3. self-replicating factories
4. non-dualist schools of thought
5. game engines
6. graphic novels

making time to grok fringe theories : sibesh[at]mayalabs[dot]io.
