Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-08T20:25:45.595460365Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/archive/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go!

However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-08T20:25:45.595460365Z","tags":[]},"/notes/archive/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, the following\ninstructions guide you through installing the proper dependencies to run it locally.\n\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly (see [[troubleshooting#`command not found: hugo-obsidian`|the troubleshooting page]])! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`. Instead, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated! Now, let's get it hosted online.\n\n\u003e üåç Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-08T20:25:45.595460365Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/archive/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](hosting.md) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-08T20:25:45.595460365Z","tags":[]},"/notes/archive/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?

An intuition surfaced by an otherwise ostracised physicist, David Bohm.\n\n\u003e ‚Äú[If it is true] then nothing will remain of my whole castle in the air including the theory of gravitation, but also nothing of the rest of contemporary physics.‚Äù\n\nTo Einstein, Bohm‚Äôs intuition was downright¬†_dangerous_.\n\nThe Twitter watering-hole erupted last week when a prominent union minister dismissed mathematical figures of a lagging economy by quoting how ‚Äúmath never helped Einstein discover gravity‚Äù. Does math help explain the economy? Perhaps. Did math really help Einstein (re)discover his equations of gravity? David Bohm, who this essay is about, would vehemently claim that it didn‚Äôt. That would be among the very few ideas on which both Einstein and Bohm would agree.\n\nTo understand this, one must first understand how a gyroscope works.\n\nOne way to understand it is to write down the three equations that the book tells you about. Make sure angular momentum is conserved on all sides. Then mechanically derive the final result. Formulaic. Works every time. Can be taught en masse. Very¬†_efficient._\n\nDavid Bohm was the kind of physicist who would never understand it that way. He would imagine himself as the gyroscope, standing on his toes, perched on a gimbal, arms stretched far, pirouetting swiftly in circles, making small muscular movements to keep his balance. He would¬†_feel_¬†the behaviour of the gyroscope, understanding it‚Äôs motion through some form of muscular interiorization. The math and formulae would come later, almost as a pedestrian way of communicating that insight to others. Second-hand intuition.\n\nBohm was a throwback to the earlier days of physics which was unusual even in his time ‚Äì An era of physics devoid of reams of astronomical data, quantum supercomputers, and well-intentioned ‚Äúpractical‚Äù problem solving. While a Feynman would jump on any opportunity to a solve a practical problem through complicated Feynman diagrams, Bohm would actively resist formalising his intuition, letting the muscle memory of the insight simmer, evolve, and manifest in unexpected ways.\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúDave always arrives at the right conclusions, but his mathematics is terrible. I take it home and find all sorts of errors and then have to spend the night trying to develop the correct proof. But in the end, the result is always exactly the same as the one Dave saw directly‚Äù. - Basil Hiley, Bohm‚Äôs colleague at Birckbeck College\n\nPerhaps all discovery happens this way. In the most messy, ad-hoc, inefficient manner possible, outside the sanitised corporate innovation labs. It is not surprising that when Bohm met Einstein years later, Einstein would confirm Bohm‚Äôs predilections. ‚Äú_Matter_¬†tells¬†_space_¬†how to¬†_curve_, and¬†_curved space_¬†tells¬†_matter_¬†how to move‚Äù, the basic principle behind his general theory of gravity, Einstein confirmed, was not arrived at by years of objective, rational thought. It was an¬†_irrational feeling_, a series of subtle, internal muscular sensations about four-dimensional space-time that the world didn‚Äôt yet have the mathematics to describe.\n\nThis aspect of discovery doesn‚Äôt get discussed in polite company because it is impolite to attribute the profound to the irrational. There are always more convenient explanations fit for the industrialised age ‚Äì like IQ, degrees, and the act of being European. How else does one justify the bizarre amnesia of high-school syllabi? Einstein‚Äôs equations explained the abnormalities in the behaviour of gravity, and predicted blackholes, and gravity waves ‚Äì but this came much later. The muscular intuition came first. It is merely human to rationalise irrationality in hindsight.\n\nThat said, this essay is not about how Einstein sympathised with Bohm, or vice versa. It is rather about the exact opposite.\n\n**Feeling Causality**\n\nGary Marcus, a vocal critic of the currently most popular approach to artificial intelligence ‚Äì deep learning ‚Äì¬†[wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/opinion/ai-explainability.html)¬†in The New York Times recently about how computer systems need to understand time, space and causality to be more..well, intelligent. What he means is that instead of learning by repetition that anything with two eyes, two ears and whiskers is a cat, it should learn that mammals have these features and hence anything with those features is a mammal, which breathes, excretes and reproduces, and a cat is just a special instance of such an mammal. Deep learning doesn‚Äôt posit an artificial intelligence to understand what¬†_causes_¬†a cat to be a cat, and hence it is brittle, narrow and quite dumb.\n\nDo human beings have intuitive understanding of how causality works? David Bohm would disagree. We have an explicitly¬†_local_¬†understanding of how causality works. In everyday speech, ‚Äúlocality‚Äù is a slightly pretentious word for a neighbourhood, town, or other place. But its original meaning, dating to the seventeenth century, is about the very concept of ‚Äúplace.‚Äù It means that everything has a place, a location. You can always point to an object and say, ‚ÄúHere it is.‚Äù If you can‚Äôt, that thing must not really exist. At any point we can localise the different features of a cat ‚Äì it has ears, eyes, whiskers, and a tail. So we would want our AI to do this intuitively too.\n\nIt is one of the strongest intuitions of the human experience ‚Äì at any point of time, we have a strong sense of place, and of the relation between spaces. We feel a strong sense of separation from those we love, and a particular kind of impotence at being unable to affect things far away.\n\nThe first aspect of this is ‚Äúseparability‚Äù. You can take four china plates and put each one in a different corner of the dining table. They will not cease to exist or lose any of their features‚Äîsize, style, rigidity. The entire dining table derives its properties from the set of plates that make it up; if one hamburger can be put on each plate, then a set of four plates can serve four hamburgers. The whole is the sum of its parts.\n\nThe second aspect of this intuition is ‚Äúlocal action,‚Äù which says that objects interact only by banging into one another or recruiting some middleman to bridge the gap between them. Whenever a distance separates us from someone, we know we cannot have any effect on that person unless we cross the distance and touch, talk to, punch‚Äîsomehow, make direct contact with‚Äîthat person, or send someone or something to do it for us. Modern technology does not evade this principle; it merely recruits new intermediaries. A phone translates sound waves into electrical signals or radio waves that travel through wires or open space and then get translated back into sound on the other end.\n\nLocality was the foundation stone on which Einstein built his castle. His theory of relativity formalises the locality we intuitively take for granted. Per Einstein, the speed of light is the cosmic limit on the speed of causality. Nothing occurs at infinite speed, and hence the world does not start and end at the same time. Places and things are ‚Äúseparate‚Äù, and interact via ‚Äúlocal action‚Äù, limited by this speed limit.\n\nWhat, then, would be the opposite of locality? So convincing is locality, that it‚Äôs opposite is simply referred to with the prefix ‚Äúnon‚Äù : non-locality. In the non-local picture of the universe, nothing is separate. Every particle interacts instantly with every other particle. There exists no concept of time ‚Äì the universe is created and ends at the same frozen instant of time. Similarly there exists no concept of space ‚Äì nothing can be separated, and while the whole may be a sum of it‚Äôs parts, there is no way for someone who is a part of the universe to localise the parts from the whole. As the joke goes, while a stitch in time would just confuse Einstein, a non-local universe would be his worst nightmare.\n\nDavid Bohm discovered a model of the universe consistent with all experiments, that is¬†_explicitly non-local._¬†In a book he co-wrote a few years before his death, he called it the¬†_Undivided Universe_.\n\n**Feeling Non-Locality**\n\nWe shall indulge ourselves in the absolute minutiae of math to understand what Bohmian‚Äôs idea of mechanics says. Like most good ideas, it is so horribly simple, and yet so counter-intuitive that it‚Äôs philosophical meaning has completely eluded the mainstream.\n\nAny theory of the universe can be described by how a state of set of particles is defined and how it evolves over time. In Bohmian mechanics, the state of a system of N particles (q1, q2, q3‚Ä¶qN) is described by its wave function œà=œà(**_q_**1,‚Ä¶,**_q_**N)=œà(q) . The theory is then defined by two evolution equations: Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs original equation that is basis of all of quantum mechanics:\n\n[\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1763d1b9-5f40-49d8-bb6b-2171510787ea_121x72.png)\n\n\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1763d1b9-5f40-49d8-bb6b-2171510787ea_121x72.png)\n\nAnd a secondary¬†**Guiding equation**, that Bohm called the pilot wave equation, that doesn‚Äôt get included any of the QM textbooks:\n\n[\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5b1119a-f27b-4ad6-a561-8ccd628877aa_274x70.png)\n\n\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5b1119a-f27b-4ad6-a561-8ccd628877aa_274x70.png)\n\nWhy does nobody like Bohmian mechanics? It‚Äôs predictions match up with all the other more popular interpretations of quantum mechanics, so there is no empirical reason to reject it. Most physicists say it‚Äôs because the guiding equation adds unnecessary complexity to the already elegant Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs equation, hence it must not be required. The real reason is found in the outrageous meaning the equation makes explicit. If you look carefully, the trajectory of any particle¬†**‚ÄúQ_k‚Äù**, is dependent on all other particles in the system¬†**(Q_1‚Ä¶..Q_N)**, mandated by the very simultaneity of the equality sign. No time-delayed dependence, as Einstein would like it. A speed limit isn‚Äôt even required.¬†_Explicit non-locality._¬†This dangerous idea goes against every established idea in contemporary physics, and hence amounts to sacrilege, even though it is effective. This is what the above equation when applied to set of particles passing through Young‚Äôs infamous double split experiment looks like:\n\nWhat the simulation in the video shows is the exact trajectories of a set of particles passing through either of two slits. The idea of determinate trajectories alone is alien to the world of mainstream quantum physics. Bohm‚Äôs equation further predicts how a quantum state deterministically collapses into a classical state. When mainstream quantum mechanics says that the choice of which slit the particle goes through is¬†_fundamentally_¬†random, what Bohm says is that nothing is random ‚Äì if only we knew the initial position and current position of all particles in the universe, we could simply plug it into his equation to find which slit the particle would go through.\n\nThe youtube channel Veritasium, has done us all a brilliant service by creating this video about how to visualise the guiding (pilot) wave equation :\n\nThere‚Äôs another way to intuit Bohm‚Äôs notion of an undivided universe : un-mixing drops of ink in viscous corn syrup. A hollow glass cylinder is kept inside another, and the space between is filled with viscous fluid ‚Äì corn syrup. Three drops of ink are injected into the corn syrup, in a way they appear separate (‚Äúlocalised‚Äù) from each other. On rotating the inner cylinder, the viscous corn syrup moves in layers, layers of liquid farther away from moving cylinder stay static, the ones near it move rapidly. As a result the drops¬†_appear_¬†to mix ‚Äì they go from a state of less entropy to more entropy. They coalesce into a single colour, in a way it would be impossible to separate them in a traditional liquid. But corn syrup is viscous, hence on turning back the inner cylinder, the drops magically¬†_un-mix_, and return to their initial localised positions. Here‚Äôs a video showing how this happens:\n\nThe experiment is just an analogy, but it resembles how David Bohm thought about the universe. In the experiment, there exists what Bohm calls an ‚Äúimplicate order‚Äù (the order of colours of the separate drops) that over time evolves and mixes into this non-local mixture (where nothing is separate, everything affect everything else). Nothing in the mixture appears separate, yet it is ‚Äì if the universes trajectory was rolled back, it would separate into it‚Äôs constituents in a predictable, determinate manner to reveal the ‚Äúimplicate order‚Äù of all the particles since an initial Big Bang event. The order Bohm speaks of is timeless, exists all the time, yet is not apparent.\n\nIn Bohm‚Äôs view, all the separate objects, entities, structures, and events in the visible or explicate world around us are relatively autonomous, stable, and temporary ‚Äúsub-totalities‚Äù derived from a deeper, implicate order of unbroken wholeness. Bohm gives the analogy of a flowing stream:\n\n\u003e On this stream, one may see an ever-changing pattern of vortices, ripples, waves, splashes, etc., which evidently have no independent existence as such. Rather, they are abstracted from the flowing movement, arising and vanishing in the total process of the flow. Such transitory subsistence as may be possessed by these abstracted forms implies only a relative independence or autonomy of behaviour, rather than absolutely independent existence as ultimate substances.\n\n\u003e (David Bohm, Routledge \u0026 Kegan Paul, London, Boston, 1980, p. 48.),¬†_Wholeness and the Implicate Order_\n\nAnother metaphor Bohm uses to illustrate this implicate order is that of the hologram. To make a hologram a laser light is split into two beams, one of which is reflected off an object onto a photographic plate where it interferes with the second beam. The complex swirls of the interference pattern recorded on the photographic plate appear meaningless and disordered to the naked eye. But like the ink drop dispersed in the corn syrup, the pattern possesses a hidden or¬†_enfolde_d order, for when illuminated with laser light it produces a three-dimensional image of the original object, which can be viewed from any angle. A remarkable feature of a hologram is that if a holographic film is cut into pieces, each piece produces an image of the whole object, though the smaller the piece the hazier the image. Clearly the form and structure of the entire object are encoded within each region of the photographic record. Bohm suggests that the whole universe can be thought of as a kind of giant, flowing hologram in which a total order is contained, in some implicit sense, in each region of space and time. When Chinese billionaire Jack Ma recently gifted a hologram gift to his employees, he would have liked to have this notion in mind.\n\nIn perhaps the most important result in the history of quantum mechanics , John Bell in the 1960s theoretically proved through his infamous¬†_Bell‚Äôs inequality_¬†that one could not accept the findings of quantum mechanics without accepting the inevitability of non-local communication. He owed his proof to a singular man ‚Äì David Bohm.\n\n\u003e **‚Ä¶ conventional formulations of quantum theory, and of quantum field theory in particular, are unprofessionally vague and ambiguous. Professional theoretical physicists ought to be able to do better. Bohm has shown us a way.**\n\n\u003e J.S. Bell,¬†_Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics_\n\n**SimulatingNon-locality**\n\nContrary to the misgivings mainstream physics has for the explicit non-locality of Bohmian mechanics, it is used a lot in one particular domain : visualising quantum mechanics via simulation. Everything from quantum tunnelling, to decoherence and time-dependent scattering, is easily plotted and evolved using perfectly deterministic classical computers.¬†[This](https://www.youtube.com/user/kvb100b/videos)¬†youtube channel explores a lot of these in multicolour detail.\n\nWhy is Bohmian mechanics so useful in computer simulations of quantum mechanics? Because while non-locality might seem strange to physicists, it is not as weird to computer scientists. The scientific question of non-locality is, ‚ÄúHow can two particles separated by half a universe be understood as connected such that they interact as though they were right on top of each other?‚Äù. If we analogise to a computer, the question would be, ‚ÄúHow can two pictures at the far corners of the screen be understood as connected such that the distance between them is irrelevant?‚Äù\n\nIn fact, the measured distance between any two pixels (dots) on the monitor‚Äôs display turns out to be entirely irrelevant, since both are merely the products of calculations carried out in the bowels of the computer as directed by the programming. The pixels may be as widely separated as you like, but the programming generating them is forever embedded in the computer‚Äôs memory in such a way that the very concept of separation in space and time of the pixels has no meaning whatsoever for the stored information, similar to Bohm‚Äôs notion of non-locality. To those familiar with programming, written in pseudo code, the guiding equation we encountered earlier looks like any other computer function:\n\n```\ntype particle {  \n   V velocity    \n   X position \n}  \n\nfunction GuidingEquation(Q_1, Q_2, Q_3....Q_N) (Q_K particle) {            \n   ...      \n   return Q_K \n\n}\n```\n\nThe above function takes in the position and velocities of ALL the particles in the computer system, and returns the position of the k-th particle. It is almost trivial to understand how the universe would evolve if it was guided by an equation like this, as opposed to something which drew explicit difference between interdependencies based on a speed limit. Whether the universe is a computer simulation or not is the unfalsifiable subject of another debate, but it certainly gives us another intuition to why non-locality may not be as strange as it appears.\n\n**Echoes From a Forgotten Past**\n\nNon-locality forces upon us an universe that by nature is undivided ‚Äì but the concept of an undivided universe is not in itself new. Cause and effect have been important topics in all ancient schools of Indian philosophy, particularly Vedanta. All schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of¬†_SatkƒÅryavƒÅda_, meaning that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. Alan Watts, a prominent Eastern philosopher describes in detail the intricate concept of¬†**_Indra‚Äôs Net_**:\n\n\u003e Imagine a multidimensional spider‚Äôs web in the early morning covered with dew drops. And every dew drop contains the reflection of all the other dew drops. And, in each reflected dew drop, the reflections of all the other dew drops in that reflection. And so ad infinitum. That is the Buddhist conception of the universe in an image. - Alan Watts\n\nThe metaphor of Indra‚Äôs Net originates from the¬†_Atharva Veda_¬†(one of the four Vedas), which likens the universe to a woven net. The net is described as being infinite, spreading in all directions with no beginning or end. At each node of the net is a jewel, so arranged that every jewel reflects all the other jewels ‚Äì similar to Bohm‚Äôs hologram metaphor. No jewel exists by itself independently of the rest. Everything is related to everything else; nothing is isolated. This net describes the universe as a web of connections and interdependencies among all its members, wherein every member is both a manifestation of the whole and inseparable from the whole.\n\nOther texts relate this to the idea of¬†_Brahman_¬†(not to be confused with¬†_brahmin_, which is a caste identity). Even seemingly disparate elements are described as nothing other than reflections of this¬†_Brahman_, and hence of one another. This notion of an organic unity ‚Äì a non-locality ‚Äì is a signature of Indian and most of Eastern philosophy, and distinguishes it from all major Western philosophies ‚Äì that are explicitly local in nature.\n\nVidyƒÅranya in his Panchadasi (V.4) explains the meaning of the phrase, or¬†_mahavakya_, ‚Äú_Aham Brahmasmi_‚Äú:\n\n\u003e Infinite by nature, the Supreme Self is described here by the word¬†_Brahman_¬†(lit. ever expanding; the ultimate reality); the word¬†_asmi_¬†denotes the identity of¬†_aham_¬†and¬†_Brahman_. Therefore, (the meaning of the expression¬†_Aham Brahmasmi_¬†is) ‚ÄúI am Brahman‚Äù.\n\nBohm was astute enough to know the difference between science and¬†_scientism_. A communist who was literally and figuratively ostracised from America during the Cold War, and from the physics community at large, he knew that physicists harboured as much dogma as the mystic shamans. It is no surprise, that the technique of Bohmian Dialogue ‚Äì which acknowledged that rigorous science and schools of philosophy both have similar goals ‚Äì to arrive at an understanding of thought and reality. And so there must be a dialogue in a civilised space, reconciling differences in the absent of any judgement. His dialogues with his collaborator, Jiddu Krishnamurti, an Indian philosopher, have filled many books.\n\nThere is however one man‚Äôs intuition which Bohm‚Äôs notions of locality have never been reconciled with till date. A theory that was as popular as Bohm‚Äôs ideas were unpopular ‚Äì Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity. Explicit locality. Even today, the many bastions of mainstream physics reject Bohm on these grounds, as if their own vague theories of quantum mechanics are somehow perfectly consistent with relativity.\n\n**Bringing Back the Absolute Frame**\n\nEinstein‚Äôs theory of relativity says that the laws of physics work the same everywhere, regardless of the frame of reference i.e. (1) No frame of reference is privileged in relation to all other frames. (2) All frames of reference are privileged in relation only to themselves.\n\nPrior to Einstein, most scientists believed in a ‚Äúluminiferous ether‚Äù, posited by Lorentz‚Äôs ether theory. The ether was an unobservable all-pervading absolute frame of reference, such that time was definitive only when at rest in that ‚Äúether‚Äù rest frame. Time in this rest frame was the yardstick that time in all other frames in motion would be relative to. They assumed that as beings on the surface of the earth traveling in the ether rest frame , our timing measurements must be distorted, although it was not possible to know by how much. Einstein‚Äôs contribution was to note that even if there were an invisible ether rest frame that we were traveling through, we could still define our inertial rest frame to have all the characteristics of a ether rest frame so that¬†_our_¬†timing measurements were definitive while timing measurement made at rest in the elusive ether would be distorted. In other words, it didn‚Äôt matter whether there really was an ether or not, we could define our own inertial rest frame and everything would work out just fine. In fact the idea of ‚ÄúLorentzian tranformations‚Äù used by Einstein to transform event in one frame of reference to another, is borrowed from Lorentz‚Äôs ether theory, which required there to exist an absolute frame of reference in the first place.\n\nIn short, Einstein‚Äôs approach was decidedly positivist ‚Äì if scientists with PhDs couldn‚Äôt observe the ether, then it meant that it did not exist, and hence wasn‚Äôt worth bothering about. Lorentz ether theory with an absolute rest frame made the same predictions as Einstein‚Äôs special theory of relativity, it was merely another interpretation of the phenomenon described by SR. In truth, there is nothing that prevents the existence of an absolute frame of reference, except Einstein‚Äôs postulates that explicitly say otherwise. The luminiferous ether hence was as quickly forgotten as Bohm‚Äôs ideas about mechanics.\n\nIn no matter of coincidence, the fundamental reason why Bohm‚Äôs notion of reality is inconsistent with Einstein‚Äôs relativity is due to the necessity of faster-than-light propagation i.e. non-locality inevitably picks out a preferred frame. The guiding wave described by Bohm‚Äôs guiding equation works non-locally in this absolute frame. This explicitly violates Einstein‚Äôs postulates. A postulate however, it should be noted, is not a divine truth, but merely an arrangement of words. There are those who believe rabidly in postulates given by men, but can an appeal to an authority that starts with an E instead of a G be really called the scientific method?\n\nCould a neo-Lorentzian ether theory of relativity that explains gravity via an absolute frame, coupled with Bohmian mechanics result in a unified theory of everything? Perhaps. It would certainly do away with the locality-non-locality debate. But we would first need to reject every epistemological notion about physics we hold, and certainly those postulates handed down by science‚Äôs favourite neighbourhood genius, Albert Einstein. If that isn‚Äôt a controversial idea, then maybe 9/11 was indeed an inside job.\n\n**A Delicate House Of Cards**\n\nWhile critiquing Einstein is easy, it is also easy to forget that he was the first to notice the inconsistency. In his famous paper describing what is known today as the EPR paradox, he would list his problems with the inherent non-locality in quantum mechanics, or what he called ‚Äúspooky-action-at-a-distance‚Äù. In so many words, his message was clear : ‚ÄúMy intuition tells me this is wrong, and hence it is wrong(or incomplete)‚Äù.\n\nB.R. Ambedkar, the composer of the Indian constitution was Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs anti-christ. He advocated nuclearisation, industrialisation, militarisation and the abolishment of the caste system as the only way to develop the nation. Meanwhile, the Mahatma championed a rural aesthetic, the theatre of non-violence, and simple self-sustained living in the style of his many ashrams. Even today, many appropriate Gandhi to serve their own means, but looking around, India has largely gone down the way professed by Ambedkar. Both were men of powerful intuition about what¬†_felt_¬†right. Both are villains and heroes of different fan followings, but Ambedkar is mentioned in the same breath as Gandhi precisely because his intuitions were as powerful as Gandhi‚Äôs. As Leo Tolstoy would put it ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe best stories are not between the good and the bad, but between the good and the good.‚Äù\n\nAlbert Einstein‚Äôs intuition, the castle in the air that put locality above everything else, will perhaps attain a similar measure of piousness that Gandhi has. Bohm‚Äôs ideas too have mostly stayed outside the mainstream for mainly epistemological reasons, relegated to the elephant graveyard of physics, trying to make their way in. It is a crime of human bias, as John Bell puts it:\n\n\u003e Bohm‚Äôs 1952 papers on quantum mechanics were for me a revelation. The elimination of indeterminism was very striking. But more important, it seemed to me, was the elimination of any need for a vague division of the world into ‚Äúsystem‚Äù on the one hand, and ‚Äúapparatus‚Äù or ‚Äúobserver‚Äù on the other. I have always felt since that people who have not grasped the ideas of those papers ‚Ä¶ and unfortunately they remain the majority ‚Ä¶ are handicapped in any discussion of the meaning of quantum mechanics. Why is the pilot wave picture ignored in textbooks? Should it not be taught, not as the only way, but as an antidote to the prevailing complacency? To show that vagueness, subjectivity, and indeterminism are not forced on us by experimental facts, but by deliberate theoretical choice? - John Bell\n\nWhat happens to men who are firmly set in muscled intuition when they come across something counter-intuitive? It burns. Like a immune system violently responding to a pathogen. Those who‚Äôve moved past science‚Äôs most loved high-school myth, that electrons move around a sun-like nucleus in planet-like orbits have come across the usual suspects of quantum mechanics ‚Äì Bohr, Schr√∂dinger, Heisenberg et al. None of them noticed this as much as the one person whom it burned the most ‚Äì Albert Einstein. He was hence the first to point it out. The first real threat to his castle in the air. David Bohm merely aggravated it from an itch to a burn.\n\nIt takes one powerful intuition to counter another. Which is perhaps why we should listen to the most dangerous ones.","lastmodified":"2023-07-08T20:25:45.595460365Z","tags":[]},"/notes/causality":{"title":"The Unsettling Physics of Causality","content":"A general relativity theorist, Bert (GR) and a quantum mechanist, Bomm (QM), find themselves in a bar that‚Äôs about to close down.\n\n**Bartender**: I will allow you to talk aloud about physics, but it‚Äôs late, I‚Äôm tired, and if I have to listen to you both ramble on at 12 midnight, you have to leave out all the math.\n\n**Bert (GR)**¬†: Blasphemous! Understanding general relativity without Einstein‚Äôs equations is like smelling fine wine without tasting it. The beauty, the simplicity‚Ä¶\n\n**Bomm (QM)**¬†: And quantum mechanics doesn‚Äôt make sense outside of Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs equations. The¬†_wavefunction_¬†is all that is real.\n\n**Bartender:**¬†Ok, say the world is large video game working on a computer. How do I get from point A to B inside the game?\n\n**Bert (GR)**¬†: That would depend on how far point A and B are. And how fast you‚Äôre travelling.\n\n**Bartender**¬†: It‚Äôs a video game. I should be able to get from point A to B at infinite speeds.\n\n**Bert (GR)**¬†: That is impossible, of course. Everything in the universe video game must have a speed upper limit. Otherwise, if things happened at infinite speeds, all observable events would happen simultaneously. There would be nothing separating cause and effect. No concept of time. All causes and and all effects would happen at once. The video game would start, and end, at the same time.\n\n**Bartender**: Makes sense. So what‚Äôs our universe‚Äôs speed upper limit?\n\n**Bert (GR)**¬†: The speed of light. 300,000 km/s. That‚Äôs around a million times the speed of an airplane, which is why it might seem infinitely fast, but isn‚Äôt. Physics is all about causal interactions. A bullet leaves a gun and hits a person, the person then dies. The person can‚Äôt die BEFORE the bullet hits him. Cause and effect. The speed of light, hence, is the speed of causality ‚Äì i.e. the upper limit to the speed at which things happen.\n\n**Bartender**¬†: Ah. If I‚Äôm driving on the highway and there is car on the other road travelling towards me, I see it travelling at twice my speed. If my car could travel at the speed of light, I would see the opposite car travel at twice the speed of light. Doesn‚Äôt that violate your upper limit?\n\n**Bert (GM)**¬†: Ah but you see, that‚Äôs where the universe is clever in how it works. There is no absolute time, or length, or velocity. i.e. there is no absolute, fixed order of causes and effects distributed in time. It‚Äôs all¬†_**relative**_¬†to the speed at which you‚Äôre travelling i.e. your frame of reference.\n\n**Bartender:**¬†I‚Äôve heard of this one. The theory of relativity.\n\n**Bert (GM)**¬†: So if two cars were travelling towards each other at the speed of light, time would slow down for the person sitting in both those cars, so that the order of observable events would always be restricted to the speed of light. Time would grow, and distance travelled would shrink, so the velocity (which is distance divided by time) of the two cars would appear to contract. So that if the two velocities were added, it would always be less than the speed of light. Since the ordering of cause and effect is relative to the speed at which you‚Äôre travelling, all participants ‚Äì the two drivers, and also an observer standing on the side of the road ‚Äì can agree on the order of observable events, even though their individual clocks don‚Äôt match. In no case, or, in no frame of reference, can a person die, before a bullet hits him.\n\n**Bartender:**¬†So it‚Äôs a hack to prevent causal conflicts in the world. I could live with that.\n\n**Bert (GM):**¬†Well, crudely put, yes. We physicists call this¬†_**locality**_¬†‚Äì local causal relativity. Local cause and effects mean cause and effect separated by the maximum speed of causality. All of Einstein‚Äôs laws of how planets move, how black holes work, how gravity works, arise from this fundamental sacred truth. General relativity, too, simply describes the geometry of causality.\n\n**Bartender:**¬†I notice Bomm here has been quiet all along. Looks like he isn‚Äôt too happy with this explanation. What‚Äôs wrong?\n\n**Bomm (QM)**¬†: Quantum mechanics is at odds with this idea. Not only is it NOT local, it is, quite unsettlingly so,¬†_explicitly non-local._\n\n**Bartender:**¬†You mean to say that causality works faster than light? At infinite speeds?\n\n**Bomm (QM):**¬†Yes. Macroscopic objects we see around us seem to have one fixed property at a time. This tissue is white, this whisky is black . Objects at microscopic level behave differently. When isolated and until observed, they exist as a superposition of two or more possibilities ‚Äì say State Black and State White, at the same time. They collapse into one when you observe them. When you bring two of them together ‚Äì they entangle in an inseparable way. So inseparable, that if you took these two to opposite ends of the universe, separated them by lightyears, and then measured one of them, it would collapse into one of the possibilities. Say you observed Black. You would then see that the other atom would be White. Or if one was White, other would be in Black. Everytime. The atoms would seem to have conspired from across the universe to be exactly correlated, or anti-correlated. Spooky action-at-a-distance. Cause and effect separated by seemingly infinite speeds. Laboratory experiments have pinned this to 50,000 times the speed of light, but it could be much much higher. Infinite.\n\n**Bartender:**¬†Perhaps the atoms could have conspired beforehand about which state they would collapse into, and we just can‚Äôt see how they did so?\n\n**Bomm (QM)**¬†: Ok let‚Äôs run an experiment. Say I put you and Bert in a room, and told you I would ask you both three Yes-No questions, A, B, \u0026 C separately when you came out. There are two ways you could conspire to correlate answers for all 3 without me finding out ‚Äì First way, you could decide before hand to always answer Yes, or No, or some combination. For 3 questions, that is 2^3, or 8 combinations. Or the Second way ‚Äì when I ask you the question, you could call each other and decide on the answers you could give. Is there any other way you can think of in which to get exactly correlated answers to all three questions?\n\n**Bartender**¬†: No, I don‚Äôt think so.\n\n**Bomm (QM)**¬†: So as you notice here, both the ways are strictly¬†_local_¬†‚Äì whether you conspire beforehand, or call each other at the time of asking, cause and effect are always separated by the speed of causality. No instantaneous communication happens at the moment I ask the questions. One could similarly think that the atoms too could have such local communication via methods hidden from us, and Yes/No answers to be Black/White. Still with me?\n\n**Bartender**¬†: I think so.\n\nBomm takes out a napkin and writes down all the possibilities for the answers to the questions.\n\n**Bomm (QM)**¬†: Our implicit assumption here, is locality. If we indeed do assume the first way, here are all the 8 possible combinations you could have conspired to beforehand. The fact is then, that in each pre-determined conspiracy, there are at least two questions with the same answer. If we repeated this experiment a million times, would you not say then that if we added up the frequencies of the answers being same to any two questions, the sum would be greater to or equal to one? That you would at least be assured that any two questions have the same answer?\n\n**Bartender**¬†: Half of the possible combinations has at least two answers same, so I‚Äôd say half for any two questions chosen. And since there are three ways to choose any two questions, the maximum would be three times half, or 3/2, and the minimum would 1.\n\n**Bomm**¬†(QM): Correct! But experimental evidence seems to contradict this obvious result. If we repeated this experiment a million times with a pair of entangled atoms, and added up the frequencies of the answers being same to any two questions, the sum comes to hover around 3/4. Which is less than 1. Not greater than or equal to one, as our mathematical description of pre-determined strategies necessitates. A contradiction!\n\n**Bartender**¬†: Which means there is no way that the answers could have been pre-determined, no hidden conspiracy could have made them correlate their states exact with respect to the other?\n\n**Bomm (QM)**¬†: Precisely! And here lies the problem. The hidden pre-determined conspiracy in physics is called a theory of¬†_**local hidden variables**_. General relativity may wear out, so might quantum theory, but there is no way to escape this statistical contradiction, this..this inequality, as John Bell put it. As long as 3/4 is not greater than or equal 1, there can be¬†_**nolocal hidden variable theories**_. Since locality was our only assumption, and it has been disproved, we must assume non-locality.\n\n**Bartender**: So at the moment the question is asked, the atom instantaneously communicates with it‚Äôs entangled pair, faster than the speed of light? Does that mean we can use this to boost internet speeds? Download things faster than the speed of light?\n\n**Bomm (QM)**¬†: No, I‚Äôm afraid not. While the two entangled atoms are indeed correlated across huge distances, which state one of them would collapse into is completely random. You can‚Äôt control which state one of them collapses into, and so you can‚Äôt control the other‚Äôs state. Information is about controlling the flow of 0s and 1s. Here, there is no way you can control the transfer of information at speeds faster than that of light ‚Äì it would be like sending garbled random noise from one place to another. Useless.\n\n**Bartender :**¬†Ah so from what I understand, we have one theory of physics where everything happens at the speed of light, and another where everything happens at once. My car‚Äôs gear train is a local mechanism. Motion passes from one gear wheel to another in an unbroken chain. Break the chain by taking out a single gear and the movement cannot continue. Without something there to mediate it, a local interaction cannot cross a gap. On the other hand, the essence of non locality is unmediated action-at-a-distance. A non-local interaction jumps from body A to body B without touching anything in between. Like a voodoo doll injury.\n\n**Bomm (QM)**¬†: You‚Äôre picking things up really fast!\n\n**Bartender**: However, it seems like both of you deal with difficult scales ‚Äì Bert deals with large objects, and Bomm with really small ones. There‚Äôs just different laws for each. What‚Äôs to be in conflict about?\n\n**Bert (GR) :**¬†Because none of these theories put a theoretical scale at which the respective theory stops working. There is no defined line between the microscopic and the macroscopic.¬†_Theoretically_, quantum mechanics works at ALL scales. So does general relativity. Yet, the universe doesn‚Äôt work that way. Which means both are incomplete. They cannot be reconciled.¬†_Yet._\n\n**Bartender**¬†: How can two models of physics of the world be so diametrically opposite to each other? One of you swears by¬†_locality_¬†and the other can‚Äôt do without¬†_non-locality_.\n\n**Bert**: Pfft, very rich for bartenders to complain about it.\n\n**Bomm:**¬†What do you think brings us here everyday?\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-08T20:25:45.595460365Z","tags":[]},"/notes/nd/purpose":{"title":"purpose","content":"The best way to understand the mind, is to build one.\n\nThe best way to understand the universe, is to build one.\n\nBut to the non-dualist, there is no duality of purpose.\n\nTo understand one, is to understand the other.\n\nTo build one, is to build the other.\n\n\n \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-08T20:25:45.599460349Z","tags":[]},"/notes/no-secrets":{"title":"This Magic Trick Has No Secrets","content":"**Ed:**¬†Oh great shaman, I‚Äôve traveled far to the Himalayas to witness your magic trick.\n\n**Sh:**¬†Yes, I will show you it now.

I‚Äôm not leaving until you tell me the secret behind it.\n\n**Sh:**¬†Do you not see ‚Äì the result is dependent on what experiment you do! You could just look in one of the boxes, and find the atom in one of the boxes. Or do the interference experiment and find it in both. Despite your training as a physicist, do you still insist that a physical reality exists independent of your conscious observation of it?\n\n**Ed**: But in this quantum experiment, the detector apparatus in interference experiment is doing the ‚Äú_observing_‚Äú, not me. Any_thing_¬†could observe, there is no need for this consciousness mumbo-jumbo.\n\n**Sh:**¬†Ah, but that is too simple an explanation. A photon coming through one of the boxes does not observe whether or not the atom is in that box. It rather joins a superposition state with the atom. Say it moves towards a detector that‚Äôs built to fire if the atom is in the top box, and not fire if it‚Äôs in the bottom one. Should the photon hit the isolated detector, being a physical system, that detector just joins the atom-photon superposition state. The detector is simultaneously fired and unfired, and the atom is still simultaneously in both boxes. Should you get a second measuring apparatus, say your eyes, to observe the detector, it too would join the superposition, for the same reasons ‚Äì and so on and so forth a causal chain would be formed ‚Äì a giant superposition.\n\n**Ed:**¬†Yet, but when I look at the detector, I see a particular result, not a superposition.\n\n**Sh:**¬†Exactly, but how? John von Neumann showed that the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows the collapse of the wave function to be placed at any position in the causal chain from the measurement device to the ‚Äúsubjective perception‚Äù of the human observer. By definition, whatever is at the end of this causal chain must collapse the wavefunction. It should also be non-physical, not satisfying Schrodinger‚Äôs equations or any physical law, otherwise, it‚Äôd also be entangled in the superposition. Some call this ‚Äúconsciousness‚Äù, some call it¬†_ƒÄtman_, you may call it whatever you want. You may also not call it anything at all.\n\n**Ed:**¬†Ok, yes I agree, whether the atom is in superposition or not, depends on my choice of the experiment. What does my own free will specifically have to do with it? The choice of which experiment could be made by robot too. I can program a robot to take random decisions by say‚Ä¶flipping a coin if you will. Heads, it looks in the box; tails, it does the interference experiment.\n\n**Sh:**¬†Agreed, you could do that. Say we had thousand such box-pairs. And say it flipped this coin a thousand times for each pair. 550 times it got head, and so the atom stayed in one of the boxes in the pair. The other 450 times it got tails, so the atom stayed in the superposition. The result, you find, is puzzling ‚Äì the coin‚Äôs landing is mysteriously connected to what is there in the respective box-pair set! The robot‚Äôs supposedly random choice will strangely always be the ‚Äúright‚Äù choice. This would mean that there is some direct dynamic relationship between the coin landing and the observation made ‚Äì you could then conclude that the coin landing is what causes the atom‚Äôs wavefunction to collapse!\n\n**Ed:**¬†Of course that is absurd ‚Äì Bell‚Äôs theorem explicitly forbids that sort of causation. Causal relationships that travel at the speed of light, i.e. local causal relativity can never cause collapse of a wavefunction. Classical mechanics does not cause quantum phenomenon.\n\n**Sh:**¬†Very good! Now, unconvinced by the theory that the landing of the coin causes the wave-function to collapse, you replace the robot‚Äôs decision making with the only decision-making process you know has nothing to with what‚Äôs going in the box-pair. What is that?\n\n**Ed:**_My own free choice?_\n\n**Sh:**¬†Yes! You would attach a button to the robot instructing it which experiment to do. You would direct it‚Äôs actions, it would not have any agency of its own. That brings you back into the causal chain.\n\n**Ed:**¬†So what you‚Äôre saying is the world is willed into existence by my observation of it? A tree doesn‚Äôt exist when I‚Äôm not looking at it?\n\n**Sh:**¬†If there was someway to isolate a tree from local causation, like we can do conveniently for the minuscule atom, then yes it would not exist as anything other than a probability wave. But a tree doesn‚Äôt exist so, and hence your brain perceives it as a series of particles in position and time. The reason we observe only states characterized by unique positions is that we humans are beings who can experience only position (and time). Speed, for instance, is just position at two different times.\n\n**Ed:**¬†So‚Ä¶it might be conceivable that there could be other beings could experience reality differently? Maybe even possibly directly experience the superposition states whose existence we can only infer. I need some water.\n\n**Sh:**¬†Perhaps. We can never know for sure. And it‚Äôs not just me saying it ‚Äì von Neumann, Bohr, Bell, Wheeler, Wigner and a bunch of others. They and I may be wrong, but the facts are in front of you, and it is up to you to decide.\n\n**Ed:**¬†You are asking me to believe that your magic trick is explained by quantum mechanics. Surely there‚Äôs trickery involved. Your demonstration involved more than an expression of conscious intent. It required you to move your hands and open the boxes. Perhaps the mechanical opening of the box pairs, either sequentially or simultaneously, somehow physically untied and put the shoes wholly in a single box or spread them over two boxes.\n\n**Sh**: Ah but no! This magic trick has¬†_no secrets_. Nothing you have seen violates your laws of quantum physics. Quantum mechanics doesn‚Äôt have any restrictions on the size of the physical system. Our ‚Äútechnology‚Äù has merely enabled us to extend to larger objects what your Bohr of Copenhagen has taught you to accept with equanimity for the small.\n\n**Ed:**¬†I would like my shoes back, please.\n\nThe shaman looks at Ed, grinning. They go out of the room. Ed sits down to wear his shoes, bids farewell to the shaman and proceeds to leave.\n\n**THUD**. Ed has collapsed, face first, flat on the ground. The shaman looks back.\n\n**Sh:**¬†Oh, those shoelaces‚Ä¶","lastmodified":"2023-07-08T20:25:45.599460349Z","tags":[]},"/notes/pirate":{"title":"The Parable of The Robot Pirate","content":"You're AI researcher Barbadosa the pirate trainer, and the first day at the job you have to teach a new robot pirate (a deep learning model, say, JackSparrowGPT), how to find treasure at sea. If you make one of these and make infinite copies of it, you will become very rich, very quick.  \n  \nOf course, you don't have a boat yet and have never actually ventured out to sea yourself, but you do have the entire island to yourselves. So much training data to train it using gradient descent. You also have infinite compute.\n  \nSo this robot pirate, armed with a matter scanner, goes around the island inspecting every rock, every leaf, every tree.  \n  \nSometimes it comes across a puddle and scans it. He puts his feet, records what wetness feels like, and steps out. \"Oh this is a great example of a water body!\", You exclaim. Surely this is meaningful progress at building treasure-finding systems. \"I'm going to be very rich\" you exclaim.  \n  \nIt sometimes disturbs you how much resource JackSparrowGPT requires, unlike your own brain which runs on 20W of power and can learn from just a few samples. The robot pirate improves only linearly with exponential increase in data and compute you throw at it - but luckily, you have so much of it! Soon it has inspected and memorized single molecule and atom on the island. But these systems are huge and unwieldy to update, so you have to cutoff it's data at a certain date, it can't take in unlimited memory after all.  \n  \nYou create new benchmarks to test these systems. For instance, the Tidal Wave benchmark, given the water level on Tuesday, it can predict the chances of high tide on Wednesday. And because the robot has years of data about tides, of course it can make a big guess, and he gets it right once, twice, thrice. You are impressed. The smartest guy you know can also make accurate tidal wave predictions. Maybe the robot is as smart as him.  \n  \nAfter years of training it on the dynamics of every single atom on the island, you discover it has completely beaten all the island-based benchmarks. It can beat the most talented island habitants at tree climbing, puddle hopping and stone throwing. You decide that it is now time.  \n  \nYou point the robot towards the horizon and say : \"You see that line in the distance. there are great treasures beyond that line. you have to go find them and bring them back\"  \n  \nThe robot promptly agrees. It starts walking towards the sea. For the first few steps, its just like walking on island, and the robot just beat the best human walker on the \"Walking\" benchmark last year. It continues to walk, until a wave comes in lifts it off its feet. There was never any water body or experience on the island similar to this, so the robot has no idea what to do. It errors out, spluttering and choking, as it drowns, and you watch on in horror.  \n\nBut surely you can augment it with information storage and retrieval, use it's vast understanding of things on the island to embed new data not seen before - and then search through it to make a new plan for the sea. Or - the robot understands \"wetness\" and \"water body depth\", because it has a embedded vector for \"puddles\" somewhere in it's latent space, based on it's understanding of puddles the island. You can use that to understand \"the sea\" as well.\n\nYou let it loose on the sea again - but alas, while the robot can vectorize 'water body depth' of the sea, there was a property \"saline concentration\" that it never encountered in the puddles on the island. As it goes deeper into the sea, the salt gets everywhere and the circuits malfunction. You watch in horror again as it drowns.\n\nAs it turns out, the sea (like real life) is an unbounded stream of unknown, unseen evaluation data, that a robot pirate bounded by scaled-up linear regression just cannot adapt to. It has to generalize in a provably unbounded / universal manner [[1]](/notes/unbounded)\n\nYou go back to the drawing board. Backpropagation is not the way. Gradient descent must be ditched. You `rm -rf` CUDA and start from scratch.\n\n---\n  \n_This is the underwhelming state of modern machine learning, and surprisingly, what the hype / doomer AI cults are excited / worried about. There is little reason to get excited by / fear bounded robot pirates._","lastmodified":"2023-07-08T20:25:45.599460349Z","tags":[]},"/notes/unbounded":{"title":"Unbounded Generality","content":"A thought is a program, and so viewed from the lens of information theory, there are broadly three distinct universalities in entities that can think and generalize [[1]](https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1656437115901624322) : \n\n1. Computational - can run any given program\n2. Reachability - can eventually generate any program, taking arbitrary steps in the process\n3. Comparison - can compare and select program options using any criteria\n\nWhile arguably these universalities are at play for all sorts of tasks - from the mundane to the profound - their utility becomes truly clear when one examines the problem of [extreme L3 generalization](https://blog.mayalabs.io/benchmark), or discovering new knowledge that does not resemble anything in past training experience.\n\nNew discovery requires finding a new underlying explanation for two or more things that seem to have nothing in common, and then using that explanation to extrapolate a prediction about how the world works. For example, gravitational waves took ~100 years to verify in experiment, but were an early extrapolated prediction from the equations of general relativity discovered by Einstein.\n\nThis sort of discovery needs a causal understanding of [unrelated things](https://twitter.com/sibeshkar/status/1657329757158281216), a world model of them that can be malleably updated on the go, with sparse data, in order to compare and find a common subgraph between them. \n\nSay a digital agent was tasked with discovering a theory of everything - the elusive explanation that unifies the discrete small scales and continous large scales of the reality we perceive. It would need to synthesize hypothesis programs and test them against observations in both quantum mechanics and general relatively. This is a difficult, time-taking process, for a couple of reasons : \n\n1. The agent would need to poke the world along axes that are not indexed in any training data / are not represented in any geometric space\n2. The symbols/rules for expressing such an explanation likely don't exist yet, and definitely not in sufficient quantity to learn via rote\n3. The tools for building a simulated world model at the right level of abstraction would need to be constructed by the agent\n4. The synthesis process will require compressing the evolution of both QM and GR into one recursive program that models the evolution of arbitrary stretches of time, in order to find an isomorphism\n\nIf/when an isomorphism is found among pairs of such programs, that would unify both these fields. Such a common program subgraph will then have the predictive power to make new hypotheses and discoveries we don't know about yet.\n\nToday's methods are nowhere near being capable at such universality. Starting with the right questions is the first step to building them one day.","lastmodified":"2023-07-08T20:25:45.599460349Z","tags":[]}}
